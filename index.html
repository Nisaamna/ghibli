                Spirited Away is a historic anime film, not only for Studio
                Ghibli and Japan, but for the anime world in general. The
                following is a synopsis of Spirited Away, which won many awards,
                including an Oscar. Spirited Away tells the magical adventures
                of a 10 year old girl named Chihiro. The journey began when he
                was forced to follow his father and mother to move to a new
                area. On the way, they got lost. The car driven by Chihiro's
                father enters a mysterious forest and ends up in a building with
                a tunnel.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then they found a shop that served hot food. Without permission,
                Chihiro's father and mother ate the food with the assumption
                that they would immediately pay for it as soon as the shop owner
                appeared.

              <h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
              <img src="img/totoro.jpg" alt="totoro" class="featured-image" />
              <p>
                It is told about a large, hairy creature in the house where the
                brothers will live. This creature has become iconic and has been
                the mascot of Studio Ghibli for many years. Hayao Miyazaki is
                smart enough to present this character, making this film full of
                intrigue and suspense.
              </p>
              <p>
                The shape of this character is a combination of an owl (fukuro),
                neko (cat) and tanuki (raccoon). Some people consider this
                animated character created by Hayao Miyazaki to be a
                tree-guarding spirit, some even think of it as genderuwo in
                Indonesia. Even though this creature is not as scary as
                Genderuwo.
              </p>
              <p>
                This creature from Hayao Miyazaki's imagination was created to
                be a cheerful creature who likes children. Even the two brothers
                in the film really liked it. This creature often gives gifts to
                Satsuki and Mei in the form of seeds that can transform into
                large trees, in fact this character is very cute and adorable.

          <p>
            Studio Ghibli movies often revolve around serious topics like
            habitat loss, forest destruction, destruction by atom bomb,
            artificial intelligence etc., but with stories that are stirring,
            poignant, colorful, and empathetic. These stories are brought to
            life by quirky, lovable, intriguing, and magical (sometimes
            literally) characters who have attained an iconic status.
